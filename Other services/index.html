		<h2> Scope and Interpolation </h2>
		<h3> Interpolation : </h3> <p>Creating a string by combining strings and placeholder.</p>
		<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
		<p>Hello {{name}}!</p>
		<p> Whatever sitting inside the scope becomes available to the view. We need to INTERPOLATE. To do that {{"double curly bracket {}"}} and whatever we put inside the curly bracket will be interpolated by angularjs. It will look at the value in the document object model in html and binds them. </p>

		<p><strong>$scope:</strong> Its is the glue that connects the controller data to the view. </p>
		<p><strong>$timeout:</strong> Its wait for a particular time and the change the value of the view.</p>
